# Python-Projects

This repository houses python projects.

Project 1: Dictionary
This project asks the user for a word and them compares the word to a json file that is filled with words and their respective definitions. If the user word matchs a word contained in the file, then that word's definition is returned. If the user misspells a word, the program will check for similiar spellings up to a .8% of accuracy and return that word as an option. If the word is not contained then the program will ask for a new word.

Project 2: Website Blocker
This project will block you from accessing certain sites during working hours to help keep you productive. It does this by adding the blocked websites to the host file with the local IP address so that the website cannot be accessed. If you are outside working hours then the program will remove the websites from the host file. The program can be set to run in the background through the Task Scheduler Application.

Project 3: Web Scraper
This project is still underway, but in the end it will be able to access a website and scrape selected data to then be displayed.
